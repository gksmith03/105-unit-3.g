# 105-unit-3.g
This is a repository containing instructional materials and data sets for Professor Gotzler's Fall 2022 section of English 105 at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.

This repository contains 3 Python notebooks, covering basic topics in coding with Python 3, and beginner modules on using the Pandas package for data analysis.

These materials have been adapted from the excellent lessons created by the staff at the Research Hub at UNC's Davis Library.

The data set provided was generated by the WONDER database of the Center of Disease Control and Prevention (https://wonder.cdc.gov). Among many sets of data, one particular category of data sets featured on the WONDER database is the daily fine particulate matter index of countys/ regions. 

The data set csv file provided by WONDER was adapted to a simplified set with a clearer display of column data. This adaptation worked to make the data easier to read and copy for other users. 

In this repository you will find the data from WONDER's database that has already been adapted, but users may follow the steps laid out in the Data1.ipynb (https://github.com/gksmith03/105-unit-3.g/blob/main/Data1.ipynb) in order to adapt more sets provided by WONDER to a more concise formatting.
