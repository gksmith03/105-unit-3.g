# ENGL 105 Unit 3

## Overview

This is a repository containing instructional materials and data sets for Professor Gotzler's Fall 2022 section of English 105 at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.

This repository contains 3 Python notebooks, covering basic topics in coding with Python 3, and beginner modules on using the Pandas package for data analysis.

This repository also includes some raw data set that was adapted using the tutorial and beginner sets as just previously described. 

These materials have been trasnformed using the excellent lessons created by the staff at the Research Hub at UNC's Davis Library.



## Data Chosen and Purpose of Data

The raw data was generated by the WONDER database of the Center of Disease Control and Prevention (https://wonder.cdc.gov). Among many sets of data, one particular category of data sets featured on the WONDER database is the daily fine particulate matter index of counties/ regions. 

The data set csv file provided by WONDER was adapted to a simplified set with a clearer display of column data. This adaptation worked to make the data easier to read and copy for other users. 

It is hoped that other users will make use of this repository in editing column sets of data within their own findings to make it more accessible and easy to understand.

In this repository you will find the data from WONDER's database that has already been adapted, but users may follow the steps laid out in the Data1.ipynb (https://github.com/gksmith03/105-unit-3.g/blob/main/Data1.ipynb) in order to adapt more sets provided by WONDER to a more concise formatting, or their own if they so choose. 

## Analysis

Shown below is a shortened version of the graphical display of particulate matter levels in Orange County, North Carolina. By analyzing just 2003, a viewer can see the trend in particulate matter, and with a little inference it is clear that the trend is seasonal. Where the graph serves as most important is illustrated by the dots on the chart. Where the dots don't overlap, or overlap slightly, the particulate matter level at that reading differed from the average therefore providing significant data.
